# Web Portfolio

This project is a personal web portfolio designed to showcase web development skills and highlighted projects. It utilizes a combination of modern technologies to achieve a responsive and functional design.

## Technologies Used

- **Astro**: Used for efficient static rendering and the integration of various UI frameworks without sacrificing performance.
- **React**: Employed to build interactive components using a declarative design model.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A CSS framework that allows for quick designing directly within the HTML, leveraging its utilities for a responsive and consistent design.
- **CSS**: Used for custom styles where specific adjustments are needed outside of Tailwind.
- **HTML**: Provides the semantic structure of the site.
- **JavaScript**: Scripts to add additional interactivity to the React components.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the portfolio looks good on devices of all sizes.
- **Fast Loading**: Thanks to Astro, the site is pre-rendered on the server, resulting in very fast loading times.
- **Interactivity**: React allows users to interact with the site in a fluid and dynamic manner.


## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where I like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, are placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
