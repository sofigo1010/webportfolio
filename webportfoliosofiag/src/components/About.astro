      I am currently halfway through my third year of university based in
      Guatemala. Learning web development has been a thrilling journey and soon
      became one of my passions. I'm eager to continue exploring the vast
      oportunities within the field. I am very commited to keep on learning,
      staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in the industry.
      Also I'd like to keep on contributing on new projects in order to grow my
      career as a programmer.
